This code depository is for replicating the results from the bachelor thesis “Recent Developments in Random Forest and Practical Applications to Finance” by Samuel Hvidager. 

Its only necessary to run the file “random forest model and eval.R” to replicate the findings, though data collection files have also been included for transparency. 

In order to run the r file, its necessary to download the provided datasets and change the working directory to the one chosen on your computer locally. 

Use R version 4.1.3 in order to ensure compatibility with all the necessary packages.
